# Awesome resources for learning Software Architecture [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
An awesome list of resources for learning all about software architecture

## Certifications

* AWS Solutions Architect (https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)

  Certification in understanding and buiding cloud resources on the AWS platform. Recommended over the AWS Developer Certification (even for developers) as it is more exhaustive and in depth. 
  
## Books

* Evolutionary Architecture by Neal Ford, Patrick Kua, and Rebecca Parsons

  A look at where architecture is today and what architecture looks is evolving/changing is a key tenant (as opposed to up front design). Introduces the idea of testing architectural traits through fitness functions. There is some powerful/interesting ideas but a lack of concreate examples let's it down. 
 
* Clean Architecture by Robert Cecil Martin (Uncle Bob)

  Uncle Bob continues the idea of clean code and extends it to architecture. 

* Software Architecture for Developers by Simon Brown

  
* DDD by Eric Evans

  
* Accelerate by Gene Kim, Jez Humble, and Nicole Forsgren

  Coming off the back of the "State of the Devops" reports this book looks at principles and practices in software development (e.g. automated testing, continuous delivery, inspirational leadership and many more) and the impact of these on performance of software delivery. Applying scienctific techniques they draw conclusions based on data as to the which practices are most impactful and how they are linked. Great for assessing your organisation/team and looking for improvements to make.
