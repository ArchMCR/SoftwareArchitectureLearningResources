# Awesome resources for learning Software Architecture [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
An awesome list of resources for learning all about software architecture

## Certifications

* AWS Solutions Architect (https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)

  Certification in understanding and buiding cloud resources on the AWS platform. Recommended over the AWS Developer Certification (even for developers) as it is more exhaustive and in depth. 
  
## Books

* Evolutionary Architecture by Neal Ford, Patrick Kua, and Rebecca Parsons

  A look at where architecture is today and what architecture looks is evolving/changing is a key tenant (as opposed to up front design). Introduces the idea of testing architectural traits through fitness functions. There is some powerful/interesting ideas but a lack of concreate examples let's it down. 
 
* Clean Architecture by Robert Cecil Martin (Uncle Bob)

  Uncle Bob continues the idea of clean code and extends it to architecture. ** TODO ** 

* Software Architecture for Developers by Simon Brown

  ** TODO ** 
  
* Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans

  The book which introduced the concepts of DDD, domains, bounded contexts and ubiqutous language. Although very dense it is a very worthwhile read and will give you tools to tackle software design problems. Even more significant today with the explosion of microservices than when it was written. 
  
* Accelerate by Gene Kim, Jez Humble, and Nicole Forsgren

  Coming off the back of the "State of the Devops" reports this book looks at principles and practices in software development (e.g. automated testing, continuous delivery, inspirational leadership and many more) and the impact of these on performance of software delivery. Applying scienctific techniques they draw conclusions based on data as to the which practices are most impactful and how they are linked. Great for assessing your organisation/team and looking for improvements to make. 
  

## Blogs

* https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog - Phil Sturgeon 

  As authured by Phil Sturgeon (author of "Build APIs You Won't Hate") this blog talks all things API design including tools, techniques, technologies and principles with solid examples throughout.

* https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ - Martin Fowler 

  Martin Fowler and his colleagues form thoughtworks cover many topics software related including - design patterns, testing strategies, branching/feature switching strategies, technical debt. Always well reasoned and well written some of the industry best writing on subjects. 

## Talks



## Websites

* https://c4model.com/

  Website created by Simon Brown (see books) which takes the power of whiteboard daigrams and tries to add extra context and details. Whilst maintaining simplicist for creation and reading (unlike UML) this framework allows developers/architects to draw pwoerful diagrams with appropriate levels of detail.

* https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar

  Well regarded in the wider industry, Thoughtworks Technology Radar captures the current trends in technologies, tools, platforms and languages & frameworks. A great resource for finding the pulse of the industry in terms of trends and discover new ideas/tehcnologies to try. There is also a framework to develop your own technology radar to capture your organisations current approved technologies and techniques. 

## Activities

* Architecture Katas (https://archkatas.herokuapp.com/)

  A set of exercies to practices aoftware architecture. ** TO DO ** 

## Newsletters

* DDD Weekly (http://dddweekly.com/)

  A collection of links and articles curated around DDD but covering topics from the wider software space.
  
* Level Up (http://levelup.thekua.com/)

  Curated by Patrick Kua (see Evolutionary Architecture in books) this newletter is a collection of links to articles on leadership and technology. Great for those running teams of developers.
